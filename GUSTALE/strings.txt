obj_mainend_653
obj_mainend_654
obj_mainend_655

obj_mainend_656
\E0* because of you^1, not&  only was the king&  gone.../

obj_mainend_691
\E3* she was pretty mad&  after what happened&  to asgore and alphys./
obj_mainend_695
\E1* she threw the queen&  out of the castle&  with her strength./
obj_mainend_697
\E0* then she became the&  empress of the&  underground.../
obj_mainend_698
* and banished the&  queen back to the&  ruins./

\E3* even more vehement&  about destroying&  humanity than ASGORE./

obj_shop2_463
\E0* Long ago^1, ASGORE and I&  agreed that escaping would&  be pointless.../

obj_shop2_472
\E3* A human's killing us anyway^1,&  ain't that right?/%%
obj_shop2_473
* OK^1, OK^1!&* I remember it clearly now./
obj_shop2_478
\E3* It was the monthly address at&  the castle^1, and the queen&  was giving her part on&  current events./
obj_shop2_479
\E0* After finishing her update^1,&  she moved to pass the&  microphone to the king./
obj_shop2_480
\E3* However^1, she didn't realize&  the microphone was still in&  her hands when she said:/

\E2* "Your turn^1, Fluffybuns."/
obj_shop2_482
\E0* The audience burst into&  laughter./
obj_shop2_483
\E2* Realizing what she had said^1,&  she started laughing too./
obj_shop2_484
\E0* After a few moments^1, the&  king held up his arms^1.&* The crowd grew silent./

\E0* Heck no^1!&* Your eyes still work..^1.&* Go read a book or something^1!&* Wahaha!/%%
obj_shop2_498
\E0* Oh yeah..^1.&* The prophecy./
obj_shop2_503
\E4* Legend has it, an 'angel' who has&  seen the surface will descend&  from above and bring us freedom./

obj_shop2_509
\E0* That emblem actually predates&  written history^1.&* The original meaning has been&  lost to time.../
obj_shop2_516
\E4* All we know is that the&  triangles symbolize us monsters&  below^1, and the winged circle&  above symbolizes.../
obj_shop2_517
\E3* Somethin' else./
obj_shop2_518
\E0* Most people say it's the&  'angel^1,' from the prophecy.../%%
obj_shop2_519
\E0* Eh^1?&* You don't know what that is?/
obj_shop2_524
\E1* What are they teaching you&  kids in school nowadays...^1?&*\E2 Wa ha ha!/

obj_shop2_538
\E0* Folks kept saying "nice muu-&  muu" to her^1, but she kept&  thinking they were calling&  her a cow./
obj_shop2_539
\E1* So she never wore it again./
obj_shop2_540
\E3* What was the question again?/
obj_shop2_541
\E0* Oh^1.&* Right^1.&* ASGORE./
obj_shop2_542
\E3* He's a real interesting&  type of monster^1.&* The strongest type of all./
obj_shop2_543
\E0* We call 'em Boss Monsters./
obj_shop2_544
* When they have an offspring^1,&  the SOUL power of the&  parents flows into the&  child.../
obj_shop2_545
* Causing the child to grow&  as the parents age./
obj_shop2_546
\E3* But ASGORE doesn't have a&  child^1.&* So he's been stuck at the&  same age..^1.&* And probably will be forever./
obj_shop2_547
\E1* Huh^1?&* What if the child is a&  human...^1? What?/
obj_shop2_548
\E1* Nah^1. That wouldn't work^1.&* So if ASGORE's your father^1,&  he'll definitely outlive&  you./%%
obj_shop2_549
\E1* I've lived too long to&  be afraid of something&  like you./
obj_shop2_555
\E2* Try it^1, kiddo!/
obj_shop2_556

obj_shop2_557

obj_shop2_558
* King Fluffybuns^1?&* He's a friendly^1, happy-go-lucky&  kind of guy.../
obj_shop2_564
\E4* If you keep walking around long&  enough^1, you'll probably meet him^1.&*\E0 He loves to walk around and&  talk to people./
obj_shop2_565
\E3* Eh^1?&* Why do I call Dreemurr&  'Fluffybuns?^1'&*\E2 Oh^1, that's a great story!/
obj_shop2_566

obj_shop2_573
\E3* It was tragic when she left./
obj_shop2_574

obj_shop2_604
\E3* Though^1, most of the time&  the folks she attacked weren't&  bad guys^1.&* It'd be the mailman or&  something like that./

obj_shop4_622
\E4* Joke^1?&* Why are you calling it a JOKE?/
obj_shop4_623
\E3* You drew a picture of two&  dudes hugging and wrote&  "I love hugs!" on it./
obj_shop4_624
\E3* You somehow understand comedy&  EVEN LESS than that guy who&  keeps going on stage and&  crying about his family./

obj_shop4_631

obj_shop4_638
obj_shop4_639
\E5* Then my boss^1, uh^1, saw me and&  asked me what I was doing./
obj_shop4_640
\E1* I was so startled^1, the hamburgers&  in my pockets tumbled out&  onto the ground./
obj_shop4_641
\E3* Not wanting to lose face^1,&  I scrambled to pick them up!/
obj_shop4_642
\E3* But^1, as I was leaning over^1,&  the weight of the remaining&  hamburgers.../
obj_shop4_643
\E5* ... caused my pants to fall&  down./
obj_shop4_644
\E4* Then the girls laughed at me./
obj_shop4_645
\E4* Everyone calls me Burgerpants&  now./%%
obj_shop4_646
obj_shop4_647
\E6* Listen^1.&* I like you^1, little buddy^1.&* So I'm gonna save you a lot&  of trouble./

\E3* Never interact with attractive&  people./
obj_shop4_652
\E6* Unless you're "one of them^1,"&  they're just gonna take&  advantage of you./
obj_shop4_653
\E3* Like that time those two&  chicks asked me to sneak them&  some glamburgers./
obj_shop4_654
\E6* And I^1, naive teenager that&  I was^1, said yes to them./
obj_shop4_655
\E4* Bad idea./%%
obj_shop4_656
\E4* Those girls?&* The ones who saw my pants&  fall down?/
obj_shop4_662
\E5* Well^1, we're all gonna be&  free^1, so I'll never see&  them again^1, at least!/%%
obj_shop4_663

obj_shop4_671
\E4* Well^1, Saul didn't tell me&  I HAD to work, I guess.../
obj_shop4_678
\E3* But that's the thing^1!&* Sometimes he doesn't even&  call me into work until&  halfway into my shift!/
obj_shop4_679
\E4* If I don't play it safe^1,&  he's going to yell at me./
obj_shop4_680
\E6* Okay^1, maybe "yell" is the&  wrong term./
obj_shop4_681
\E4* It's more like he has this..^1.&* CD album he plays.../
obj_shop4_682
\E5* That's entirely full of&  songs about how bad I am&  at my job./%%
obj_shop4_683
\E5* Let's not talk about this./%%
obj_shop4_698
\E1* Why do people find him so&  attractive??/
obj_shop4_704

obj_shop4_708

obj_shop4_710
\E3* God^1, have you even looked&  around^1?&* This place is a labyrinth of&  bad choices./
obj_shop4_716

obj_shop4_717
\E1Oh! Right!/
obj_shop4_718
\E3* Humans are always eating&  hamburgers made of SEQUINS&  AND GLUE./%%
obj_shop4_719
\E5* When I first came to Hotland^1,&  it was my dream to work&  with Saul./
obj_shop4_724
obj_shop4_725

\E3* Don't tell anyone this^1, Little&  Buddy./
obj_shop4_734
\E4* (Because they'll make fun&  of me,)/

\E5* I think I did something!/

obj_shop4_739
\E3* Huh?&* Everyone else is DEAD?/
obj_shop4_744
obj_shop4_745
\E5* Does that mean I don't&  have to work today?/
obj_shop4_746
\E6* God^1.&* That it were true^1,&  little weirdo^1.&* That it were true./%%
obj_shop4_747
\E3* Future^1?&* WHAT future^1?&* Nothing down here EVER&  changes./
obj_shop4_756

A long time ago,&a human fell&into the RUINS./*
obj_storybattle_gen_295
Injured by its&fall, the human&called out for&help./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_307
GUSTAVO^1, the king's&son^1, heard the&human's call./*
obj_storybattle_gen_333
He brought the&human back to&the castle./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_345
Over time^1, GUSTAVO&and the human&became like&siblings./*
obj_storybattle_gen_370
The King and&Queen treated the&human child as&their own./*
obj_storybattle_gen_383
The underground&was full of&hope./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_395
Then..^1.&One day.../*
obj_storybattle_gen_421
The human became&very ill./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_433
The sick human&had only one&request./*
obj_storybattle_gen_459
To see the&flowers from&their village./*

But there was&nothing we could&do./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_484
The next day./*
obj_storybattle_gen_511
The next day./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_523
obj_storybattle_gen_546
The human died./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_558
GUSTAVO^1, wracked&with grief^1,&absorbed the&human's SOUL./*
obj_storybattle_gen_583
He transformed&into a being&with incredible&power./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_594
With the human&SOUL^1, GUSTAVO&crossed through&the barrier./*
obj_storybattle_gen_609
He carried the&human's body&into the sunset./*
obj_storybattle_gen_622
Back to the&village of the&humans./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_634
GUSTAVO reached&the center of&the village./*
obj_storybattle_gen_649
There^1, he&found a bed of&golden flowers./*
obj_storybattle_gen_662
He carried&the human&onto it./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_674
Suddenly^1, screams&rang out./*
obj_storybattle_gen_689
The villagers&saw GUSTAVO&holding the&human's body./*
obj_storybattle_gen_702
They thought&that he had&killed the&child./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_714
The humans&attacked him&with everything&they had./*
obj_storybattle_gen_727
He was struck&with blow after&blow./*

GUSTAVO had the&power to destroy&them all./%%

obj_storybattle_gen_778
Clutching the&human.../*

GUSTAVO smiled^1,&and walked away./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_816
Wounded^1, GUSTAVO&stumbled home./*
obj_storybattle_gen_832
He entered the&castle and&collapsed./*
obj_storybattle_gen_845
His dust spread&across the&garden./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_857
The kingdom fell&into despair./*

The king and&queen had lost&two children&in one night./*

The king decided&it was time to&end our&suffering./*

obj_storybattle_gen_1077
\E9Today's gonna be&just as fun./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_1078
\E1I remember when I&first woke up here^1,&in the garden./
obj_storybattle_gen_1093
I was so scared./
obj_storybattle_gen_1094
\E2I couldn't feel my&arms or my legs.../
obj_storybattle_gen_1095
\E1My entire body had&turned into a&flower!/
obj_storybattle_gen_1096
\E5"Mom^1! Dad^1!&Somebody help me^1!"&I called out./
obj_storybattle_gen_1097
\E9But nobody came./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_1098
\E1Eventually^1, the king&found me^1, crying in&the garden./
obj_storybattle_gen_1107
I explained what had&happened to him./
obj_storybattle_gen_1108
Then he held me^1,&\[C]./
obj_storybattle_gen_1109
He held me with&tears in his eyes^1,&saying.../
obj_storybattle_gen_1110
"There^1, there^1.&Everything is going&to be alright."/
obj_storybattle_gen_1111
He was so..^1.&Emotional./
obj_storybattle_gen_1112
\E1But..^1.&For some reason.../
obj_storybattle_gen_1113
\E1I didn't feel&anything at all./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_1114
\E1I soon realized I&didn't feel ANYTHING&about ANYONE./
obj_storybattle_gen_1123
My compassion had&disappeared!/
obj_storybattle_gen_1124
\E7And believe me^1,&it's not like I&wasn't trying./
obj_storybattle_gen_1125
\E3I wasted weeks with&that stupid king^1,&vainly hoping I would&feel something./
obj_storybattle_gen_1126
\E1But it became too&much for me./
obj_storybattle_gen_1127
I ran away from&home./
obj_storybattle_gen_1128
Eventually^1, I reached&the RUINS./
obj_storybattle_gen_1129
\E0Inside I found HER^1,&\[C]./
obj_storybattle_gen_1130
I thought of all&people^1, SHE could&make me feel whole&again./
obj_storybattle_gen_1131
obj_storybattle_gen_1132
\E7She failed./
obj_storybattle_gen_1133
\E6Ha ha.../%%
obj_storybattle_gen_1134
\E1I realized those two&were useless./
obj_storybattle_gen_1144
I became despondent./
obj_storybattle_gen_1145
I just wanted to&love someone./
obj_storybattle_gen_1146
I just wanted to&care about someone./
obj_storybattle_gen_1147
\[C]^1, you might&not believe this.../
obj_storybattle_gen_1148
\E2But I decided..^1.&It wasn't worth&living anymore./
obj_storybattle_gen_1149
\E7Not in a world&without love./
obj_storybattle_gen_1150
\E6Not in a world&without you./
obj_storybattle_gen_1151
\E1So.../
obj_storybattle_gen_1152
\E0I decided to follow&in your footsteps./
obj_storybattle_gen_1153
\E1I would erase myself&from existence./
obj_storybattle_gen_1154
\E1And you know what?/
obj_storybattle_gen_1155
\E0I succeeded./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_1156
\E1But as I left this&mortal coil.../
obj_storybattle_gen_1165
I started to feel&apprehensive./
obj_storybattle_gen_1166
\E9If you don't have&a SOUL^1, what happens&when you...?/
obj_storybattle_gen_1167
\E1Something primal&started to burn&inside me./
obj_storybattle_gen_1168
"No^1," I thought^1.&"I don't want to&die!"/
obj_storybattle_gen_1169
obj_storybattle_gen_1170
Then I woke up./
obj_storybattle_gen_1171
Like it was all&just a bad dream./
obj_storybattle_gen_1172
I was back at the&garden./
obj_storybattle_gen_1173
\E0Back at my&"save point."/%%
obj_storybattle_gen_1174
Interested^1, I decided&to experiment./
obj_storybattle_gen_1183
Again and again^1, I&brought myself to&the edge of death./
obj_storybattle_gen_1184
At any point^1, I&could have let this&world continue on&without me./
obj_storybattle_gen_1185
But as long as I&was determined to&live.../
obj_storybattle_gen_1186
\E0I could go back./
obj_storybattle_gen_1187
\E6Amazing^1, isn't it^1,&\[C]?/
obj_storybattle_gen_1188
\E0I was amazed^1, too./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_1189
\E1At first^1, I used my&powers for good./
obj_storybattle_gen_1197
\E0I became "friends"&with everyone./
obj_storybattle_gen_1198
I solved all their&problems flawlessly./
obj_storybattle_gen_1199
Their companionship&was amusing.../
obj_storybattle_gen_1200
\E1For a while. /
obj_storybattle_gen_1201
\E1As time repeated^1,&people proved&themselves&predictable./
obj_storybattle_gen_1202
What would this&person say if I&gave them this?/
obj_storybattle_gen_1203
What would they do&if I said this to&them?/
obj_storybattle_gen_1204
Once you know the&answer^1, that's it./
obj_storybattle_gen_1205
That's all they are./%%
obj_storybattle_gen_1206
\E1It all started&because I was&curious./
obj_storybattle_gen_1217
\E0Curious what would&happen if I killed&them./
obj_storybattle_gen_1218
\E2"I don't like this^1,"&I told myself./
obj_storybattle_gen_1219
\E1"I'm just doing this&because I HAVE to&know what happens./
obj_storybattle_gen_1220
\E8Ha ha ha..^1.&What an excuse!/
obj_storybattle_gen_1221
\E9You of all people&must know how&liberating it is to&act this way./
obj_storybattle_gen_1222
\E8At least we're better&than those sickos&that stand around and&WATCH it happen.../
obj_storybattle_gen_1223
\E9Those pathetic people&that want to see it^1,&but are too weak to&do it themselves./
obj_storybattle_gen_1224
\E0I bet someone like&that's watching right&now^1, aren't they...?/%%
obj_storybattle_gen_1225
\E1Nowadays^1, even that's&grown tiring./

\E7You understand^1,&\[C]./
obj_storybattle_gen_1236
\E6I've done everything&this world has to&offer./

How did you get&back to the RUINS&from here...?/

obj_torinteractable7_161
* The control over our&  body was actually split&  between us./
obj_torinteractable7_162
* They were the one&  that picked up their&  own empty body./
obj_torinteractable7_163
* And then^1, when we&  got to the village.../
obj_torinteractable7_164
\E2* They were the one&  that wanted to.../
obj_torinteractable7_165
\E1* ... to use our full&  power./
obj_torinteractable7_166

\E1* Well^1, that's why I&  ended up a flower./
obj_torinteractable7_169
obj_torinteractable7_170
* This whole time^1, I've&  blamed myself for&  that decision./

\E7* But now..^1.&* After meeting you.../

* If I killed those&  humans.../
obj_torinteractable7_177

obj_torinteractable7_179
\E7* I still feel kind&  of sad knowing how&  long it took.../
obj_torinteractable7_180
\E0* ... so maybe it&  wasn't a perfect&  decision./
obj_torinteractable7_181

\E7* Well^1, not that I&  have much of a life&  left./

obj_torinteractable7_197
\E0* Be careful in the&  outside world^1, OK?/
obj_torinteractable7_198

礼を言おう。/

ここにはもう&私たちに必要なものはない。/
こんな世界は今すぐ消し去^1り&次へ進もう。/%%
「\[C]」。/

だが。/
お前と私は同類ではない^1…&そうだな？/

私には…/
もはや　お前の感情は&理解できない。/
しかし　それでも…/
私はお前に&提案せねばならない…/
いま一度　この世界を&つくり直すか　と。/
お前には　“別のルート”のほうが&ふさわしいのでは…？/
さあ　パートナーよ…/
ともに　この世界を&深淵の闇に葬ろう。/%%
やは^1り　お前は&優秀なパートナーだ。/
私たちは　永遠^1に&離れることはない。/%%
ほう…？/
それは興味深い。/
どうやらお前は&理解していないようだ。/
お前は　いつか^1ら&私に指図する立場になったのだ？/%%
お前が抱く　この感情…/
これこそ　まさに　私が今&言及したものだ。/
