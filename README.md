# GUSTALE
GUSTALE  
![Gus](https://github.com/RKReid/GUSTALE/blob/main/gus.png?raw=true)  
An UNDERTALE hack all about Gustavo Fring.        
The player has fallen into the Underground, or Los Pollos Hermanos. They must make their way outside.  
Many Gustavo Frings challange and fight the player to prevent them from leaving Los Pollos Hermanos.

## Platforms  
GUSTALE is currently being developed on Windows. It will be ported to all platforms UNDERTALE is on, so that would be on  
PS4/PS5  
PSVita  
Xbox 1/Series X  
Linux  
  
  
There's also Mac, but I don't care about Mac. The 5 people that use Mac can port it themselves.  
I have tested GUSTALE on a PSVita emulator, and it ran perfectly, as seen below
